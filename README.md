# Arduino LED Strip Project

## Tools Involved
- Arduino Sketch

## Hardware List
- Arduino UNO
- IRLZ44N MOSFETs
- Sound Detection Module (KY-037)
- Jumper Wires
- BreadBoard
- 12V PSU (Power Supply Unit)
- 12V RGB LED Strip

## How To Turn On The Lights
I adjusted my Sound Detection Module to detect hand claps (and loud sounds in general). These results will vary depending on how you have adjusted the potentiometer on the module. If you're just getting started, rotate the potentiometer (the little screwhead) counter-clockwise and aim for when LED2 just flickers with a little bit of noise. 

## Why Did I Make This Project?
I didn't like having to grab my remote everytime I wanted to turn on my lights, so I thought to myself, what's a fun and better way to do it? I didn't have a set-plan from the start because I didn't know that much about electronics and arduinos, so I just gradually built and adjusted my plans as I learned to do it. 

## Future Plans
In the future, I plan to use a Voice Recognizier to turn on the lights. The sound detection is great and all but it does have its flaws.
